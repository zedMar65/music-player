# Music Player

This project was created by two high school students as their music class project.

The program allows you to create music by creating note blocks and dragging them around in different semitone positions.

It also includes a music converter that easily generates data for the player from musical letter notation and more.

## Usage

1. Download the project (and unzip if needed).
2. Open `index.html` with your favorite browser.
3. Enjoy.

## Examples

All examples are in the [examples folder](examples/). To try them, copy data from the files and import them into the player.
